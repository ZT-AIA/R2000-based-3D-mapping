@par Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that implement a PTPD client
application, based on the socket API, for STM32F4x7 devices.

Please note that for http server socket demonstration, LwIP v1.4.1 is used a 
the TCP/IP stack and Keil RTX v4.73 is used as the Real Time Kernel.  The
libraries have been modified as needed to support PTPD functionality.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  
  - This example has been tested with the following hardware:
    - STM32F4DISCOVERY board
    - STM32F4DIS-BB for the Base Board
    - STM32F4DIS-LCD for the LCD module

  - Software development tools
    - MDK-ARM V5.10

  - Hardware Set-up
    - Mount STM32F4DISCOVERY board onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON1 and CON2
    - Mount STM32F4DIS-LCD module onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON3
    - Connect the STM32F4DIS-BB board to a PC with a crossover Ethernet cable through RJ45 connector J1
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable 
      through USB connector CN1 to power the board.

  In order to load the Project code, you have do the following:

   - MDK-ARM
      - Open the Discovery.uvproj project
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
      - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
      - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)
